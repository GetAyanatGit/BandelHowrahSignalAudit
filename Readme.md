# BandelHowrah Signal Audit Project

This repository contains the complete data collection, processing, and analysis pipeline for the Bandelâ€“Howrah railway mobile network signal audit. 

The project leverages a custom-built mobile logger app (*SanketSetu*) developed in Python (Kivy, Plyer) running on Android devices to capture real-time GPS and cellular signal metrics along the route. Data is processed using PySpark and visualized with Plotly for insightful network performance evaluation.

Future improvements include advanced feature selection, predictive modeling, and AI-driven connectivity insights.

All source code, datasets, and documentation will be maintained here for transparency and collaboration.
